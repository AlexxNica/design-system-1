usage: "Date Picker popovers activate when the user clicks anywhere within the date box (either text area or calendar icon). The current date is circled 
(September 30th in example to the left), the dark blue circle is shown when a date has been selected and the calendar popover is reopened, and the light blue circle shows where the user is hovering their cursor. After a date is selected, the popover closes and the date in the box updates to the selected date."
