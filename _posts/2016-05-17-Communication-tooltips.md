title: Tooltips
layout: component
author: Evan Nabors
category: Communication
usage: Tooltips are used to provide a quick explanation of text or an icon. As mentioned previously, they do not contain full sentences, they can only be one line, and are only activated on hover. The text inside of a tooltip cannot be highlighted or copied. A carrot is used to show which element is being explained. The direction of the tooltip off of the element is flexible, as demonstrated here.
