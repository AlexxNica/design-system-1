title: Pop Overs
layout: component
author: Evan Nabors
category: Containers
usage: 'Popovers are an effective way of giving the user information about an element or the option to take action on an element, while keeping context and without having to leave the page entirely. Popovers are activated by a click, or automatically with page load (see the “Assistive” example). They can be dismissed by clicking on an “x” in the upper right-hand corner, by clicking on an action button within the popover, or by clicking anywhere outside of the popover. Popovers can be strictly informative, or they can prompt an action from the user. Popovers are the top layer of a page; they “float” above all other elements on a page and often include a drop shadow to convey this, although it is not required.'
