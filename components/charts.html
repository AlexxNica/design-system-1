<h1 class="ws-section-head">Chart Basics<span class="status prototype">In Progress</span></h1>
<p class="ws-first-p">When considering using a data visualization in your project, always value <b>substance over flash</b>. The most important thing is making sure it is easy to interpret the data and glean insights. Charts can also present accessiblity chanlenges designers must address. Remember to keep in mind color blind users, keyboard accessibility, and users with screen readers.</p>
<p>Best practices include:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Labeling</b> the chart and axises. Don't make the user guess what data points mean. The only case an axis label isn't needed is when the x-axis shows time.</li>
	<li>Using a <b>legand</b> when differences in color and pattern convey information in charts.</li>
	<li>Verifying chart <b>colors can be differentiated</b> by colorblind users. When possible, <b>use patterns</b> in addition to color to differentiate data.</li>
	<li>Displaying a <b>threshold or average line</b> with the information is available. This give the user quick context as to whether they are doing better or worse than expected.</li>
	<li>Verifying the information in the charts is also available to someone using a <b>screen reader</b>.</li>
	<li>Never fully relying on hover tooltips to convey information.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="ws-section-head">Statistic<span class="status prototype">In Progress</span></h1>
<p class="ws-first-p"><b>Before considering any data visualization</b>, consider showing a simple statistic. If you can tell the user what they want to know without interpret a chart, that is preferred.</p>



<h1 class="ws-section-head">Bar Chart<span class="status prototype">In Progress</span></h1>
<p>Use: <b>comparison between items</b> or <b>comparison thoughout time</b></p>
<p >Bar charts can help the user quickly identify high and low values in data sets. You can compare items against each other, such as in the first example. In the second example, the same item is compared overtime. A line chart could also be used in this scenario and works better if you are showing more than 12 data points. Bar charts work best if large differences between bars are expected. Subtle fluctuations will be harder to identify in a bar chart than in a line chart.</p>

<p class="ws-first-p">Bar in charts with a single data set should be the same color, and there is no need to show a legend.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="span-1"></div>
</div>

<h3>Multiple Data Sets</h3>
<p>Up to four data sets can be compared overtime using a bar chart. Each data set should be a unique color, and a legand must be displayed. Clicking on a data set label in the legend toggles between showing and hiding that information in the chart.</p>
<p class="ws-first-p">In order to show multiple data sets on the same bar chart, the same y-axis must be represent the same variable. If the y-axis variables are different, show the information in separate charts.Creating multiple y-axises can make charts misleading and cause confusion.</p>

<h1 class="ws-section-head">Bubble Chart<span class="status prototype">In Progress</span></h1>
<p>Use: <b>show relationship</b> or <b>show three variables</b></p>
<p>A bubble chart displays three variables of data at a time. It can show the correlation between the x- and y-axis variables. A third variable determine the size of the bubble. Be conciancious of the number of bubbles and the size of the chart. Too many bubbles on too small of a chart can create a useless visualization.</p>
<p class="ws-first-p">A legend doesn't necessarily need to be shown with this chart. However, it can be used to filter what bubbles are displayed and therefore helpful in some circumstances.</p>

<h1 class="ws-section-head">Line Chart<span class="status prototype">In Progress</span></h1>
<p>Use: <b>trends over time</b></p>

<p class="ws-first-p">Much of the guidence around bar charts also applies to line charts. Line charts with a single line do not need a legend. Up to six lines can be displayed on a single chart with a legend. Lines must be throroughly differentiated with color or pattern. The same y-axis variable must apply to all lines on the chart.</p>

<h3 class="ws-charts-h3">Variations</h3>
<p class="ws-first-p">Chart.js allows for customization. The tension on the lines can be changed to make the lines more rounded. The area beneath the line can also be filled; however, this affect should only be used if there is one line on the chart.</p>

<h1 class="ws-section-head">Pie and Doughnut Charts<span class="status prototype">In Progress</span></h1>
<p class="ws-first-p">Pie and doughnut charts are probably the most commonly used chart there are. They are divided into segments, the arc of each segment shows the proportional value of each piece of data.

They are excellent at showing the relational proportions between data.

Pie and doughnut charts are effectively the same class in Chart.js, but have one different default value - their cutoutPercentage. This equates what percentage of the inner should be cut out. This defaults to 0 for pie charts, and 50 for doughnuts.

They are also registered under two aliases in the Chart core. Other than their different default value, and different alias, they are exactly the same.</p>

<h1 class="ws-section-head">Polar Area Chart<span class="status prototype">In Progress</span></h1>
<p class="ws-first-p">
Polar area charts are similar to pie charts, but each segment has the same angle - the radius of the segment differs depending on the value.

This type of chart is often useful when we want to show a comparison data similar to a pie chart, but also show a scale of values for context.

<h1 class="ws-section-head">Radar Chart<span class="status prototype">In Progress</span></h1>
<p>Use: <b>identify outliers</b> or <b>layer up to three data sets</b></p>
<p class="ws-first-p">Radar charts are a way of comparing multiple quantitative variables. This makes them useful for seeing which variables have similar values or if there are any outliers amongst each variable. Radar Charts are also useful for seeing which variables are scoring high or low within a dataset, making them ideal for displaying performance.

Do not overlay more than three d</p>
