  <h1>Personas</h1>
  <p>These product usage personas represent our customers using Cloud, Dedicated, Hybrid and Private Cloud infrastructures. The personas are built upon a collection of research done throughout the past year and a half. Personas will help you speak consistently about our customers, develop empathy, create real-world mappings of our customer base, recruit target users for products and prioritize design direction or solutions.</p>

  <p>The personas will continue to evolve as we gather more quantitative and qualitative data about our customers. Read more about personas on <a href="http://design.rax.io/?p=1991" target="_blank">design.rax.io</a>.</p>

  <h2>How to set it up</h2>
  <p>In order to use the full feature set of the Craft Library or start from the latest version of the Sketch template, it is important to sync the shared OneDrive folder to your computer. However, <i>syncing with OneDrive isn't quite as simple as Google Drive, so bear with us through the next few steps</i>.</p>

  <h3>Syncing a Shared OneDrive folder</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Make sure that your version of OneDrive was downloaded from the Managed Software Center</b>. Rackspace has built an update to the program that enables us to sync shared folders, so If you download it from another source it will not work. If your computer does not have the Managed Software Center installed on it, you'll need to go to O'Fixies to install it.</li>
    <li>Visit the link above and click the "Sync" button.</li>

    <li>Syncing the folder will create a second OneDrive folder on your computer. It will also add the folder as a second location to your OneDrive App. <b>TIP:</b> DO NOT rename these folders.</b></li> 
  </ol>

  <h2>How to use it</h2>

    <h3>Sketch Template</h3>
    <p>If you choose the Sketch template you can create a new file from it and edit it as you wish without affecting the original document. Sketch maintains the link to the template in your "New from Template" menu. So if you selected it from the shared drive above, it will always access the most up to date file.</p>

  <h3>Craft Library</h3>
  <p>If you aren't familiar with Craft, it is a Sketch add-on that includes a feature for shared libraries. If imported into your project the Craft library will automatically alert you when new assets are available.</p>

  <p>If you've never used Craft before, we urge you to take a minute to learn about it before diving in:</p>
