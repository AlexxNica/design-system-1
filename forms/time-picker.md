title: Time Picker
layout: website/default
author: Evan Nabors
category: Forms
usage: "The Time Picker popover functions in the same way as the Date Picker. The Time Picker popover activates when the user clicks anywhere within the time box (either text area or clock icon). After a time is selected, the user can click anywhere outside the box to save it, or they can click on the box itself, in which case the popover closes and the time in the box updates to the selected time."
